# Experiment journal

One line per concluded experiment — number, verdict, the load-bearing fact.
Full evidence lives in each experiment's `report.md`; raw outputs under
`runs/` (git-ignored, regenerable from the manifest's commit + config).

- 0001_bench_smoke — pass: greedy beats random 83.1% ± 4.7% (n=65, 2p);
  infrastructure worked example.
- 0002_linear_value_fitting — framework adopted, weights not (both targets):
  predict reaches hand level vs greedy (75.2% vs 77.8%), maximise beats it
  (80.8%), yet both lose head-to-head (~43%) — fixed-opponent optimization
  breeds specialists. Held-out AUC flat while match probes span 53–78%:
  select by matches, never fit metrics.
- 0002_linear_value_fitting/self_play — pass: 3-round champion-ladder CEM
  beat the hand-tuned weights 56.1% head-to-head (n=310, lower 2σ 50.5%) and
  80.9% vs greedy (hand: 77.8%) — fixed-opponent specialists fixed by making
  the opponent evolve; adoption of the weights deferred (leaf cascade).
- 0002_linear_value_fitting/self_play at 4p — the 2p edge does not transfer:
  27.0% ± 2.8% vs three hand lookaheads (chance 25%), 64.7% vs greedy tables
  (hand: 68.1%); champion reproduced bit-identically from config (framework
  determinism verified). Adoption now 2p-conditional or needs a mixed-count
  arena.
- 0002_linear_value_fitting/self_play_4p — near miss: the 4p-arena champion
  reads 30.4% ± 3.2% vs three hand lookaheads (chance 25%, lower 2σ 24.0%,
  n=230) and 69.3% vs greedy tables; 4p tuned slot stays hand-tuned pending
  an n≈600 confirmation.
- 0003_neural_board_architectures — pass (framework + first sweep, 12k
  positions): a jraph GNN over the *raw* board nearly matches the hand-tuned
  feature MLP — heuristic R² 0.978 vs 0.996, win AUC 0.825 vs 0.834 — while a
  structure-blind flat MLP on the same inputs is ≈chance (R² 0.54, AUC 0.52)
  and DeepSet sits between. Structure is what makes raw board features usable;
  a learnable leaf is within reach (settlrl-learn Stage 1 seam). Not yet
  promoted: close the win gap, then gate lookahead(gnn) through bench.
- 0003_neural_board_architectures — GraphNet lever ablation (2026-06-18, 20k
  positions, +`road` structural target = seat-0 longest-road trail length). On
  `road` the GNNs hit R² 0.99 vs the engineered MLP's 0.83 (replicated seed 1:
  eng 0.835, plain-MPNN 0.986) — the graph recovers a connectivity quantity the
  hand-tuned vector lacks. **Attention is the wrong bias for counting/structural
  tasks**: `gn_gat` collapses to 0.86 on `road` (sum-MPNN 0.99) while leading on
  the global `win` target (0.77) — the target's locality picks the architecture.
  GraphNorm and jumping-knowledge don't pay on a 54-node graph. Every preset is
  board-symmetry + player-relabel invariant (no absolute PE). Recommended net:
  `gn_global` (sum-MPNN + virtual global node + multi-aggregator readout +
  LayerNorm; no attention/GraphNorm/JK) — the robust all-rounder for the AZ
  value+policy net.
- 0003 multi-task + road-reasoning probe (2026-06-18). Multi-task (shared trunk,
  head per target win+heur+road+turns): negative transfer onto the structural
  `road` head (gn_global 0.98→0.82) while easy heads hold; plain `gn_base` is the
  most robust trunk and its win head *improves* (0.738→0.766) from the structural
  auxiliary — a single AZ value+policy trunk wants sum-MPNN + loss-balancing.
  Road probe (`road_probe.py`, controlled paths/branchy/broken mix): the GNN is
  not edge-counting (on |count-longest|≥2 cases it predicts true longest 7.2 not
  count 11.1) but is depth-limited as expected — 1 layer fails (R² 0.58), depth 2
  →0.92, then plateaus; greedy road 0.99 was an easy near-simple-path artefact.

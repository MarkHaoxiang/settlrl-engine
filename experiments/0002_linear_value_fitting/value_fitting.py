"""The linear value-fitting framework (see experiments/CLAUDE.md).

One experiment = one ``CONFIG`` driving :func:`run_experiment`: pick the
feature subset (``BoardFeatures`` names) and the optimisation target —
``"predict"`` fits weights to predict game outcomes against a known opponent
(logistic and sign-constrained NNLS, on all positions and the early halves,
ranked by match probes); ``"maximise"`` searches weight space directly for
match win rate with a cross-entropy loop. Either way the winner deploys via
``value.make_linear`` into one-step lookahead, gets benched against the
opponent next to the hand-tuned baseline, and is gated head-to-head against
``lookahead(heuristic)``.

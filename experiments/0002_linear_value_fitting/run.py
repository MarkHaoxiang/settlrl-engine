"""Linear value fitting over the hand-engineered features.

A framework for a class of experiments: optimize linear weights over
``BoardFeatures``, deploy them in one-step lookahead, and gate against the
hand-tuned weights. Pick a variant (and optional ``key=value`` overrides)::

    uv run python experiments/0002_linear_value_fitting/run.py [variant] [k=v ...]

- ``predict``   — fit weights to predict game outcomes vs a known opponent
- ``maximise``  — CEM search over weights for match win rate vs a known
  opponent
- ``self_play`` — iterated maximise: each round's opponent is the current
  champion (round 0: the hand weights), challengers accepted only by
  beating it; rounds are configurable
- ``self_play_wide`` — the 2p ladder over *all* engineered features (new
  terms start at weight 0; the search decides what earns weight)
- ``self_play_4p`` — the same ladder in a four-player arena (one challenger
  seat rotating against a champion table; acceptance and the gate clear the
  1/players chance line)
- ``smoke``     — trivial budgets for the end-to-end plumbing test (not a
  real result; the gate is meaningless here)

The schema below carries the defaults; ``VARIANTS`` are deltas onto them.

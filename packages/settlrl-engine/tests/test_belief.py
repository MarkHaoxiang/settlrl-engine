"""Soundness of belief tracking (``settlrl_engine.belief``) under random play.

The contract: everything in a ``BeliefState`` is derivable from public
information, the bounds always bracket the truth, and a ``BeliefView`` carries
nothing the observer couldn't know — structurally, since its type has no field

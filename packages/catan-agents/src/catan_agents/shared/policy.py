"""The seat interfaces: pure decision functions over one game's view.

Two protocols, split by what a seat consumes — neither sees anything the
player wouldn't:

- :class:`Policy` consumes the acting player's *partial observation* (the
  env's dict form, meant for learned policies).
- :class:`BeliefPolicy` consumes the engine's honest world model: a
  :class:`~catan_engine.belief.BeliefView` (the public board fields plus
  proven bounds on hidden hands — no ``BoardState``, so nothing hidden can
  even be represented). Model-based agents rebuild a concrete world from it
  by sampling (:func:`catan_agents.shared.sample.sample_world`) and search in
  the sample.

Both are valid at any player count; belief sharpness, not the API, is what
varies with the seat count (with two players the belief pins the opponent's
resources exactly).

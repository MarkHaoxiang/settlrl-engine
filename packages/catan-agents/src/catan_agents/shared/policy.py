"""The seat interfaces: decision functions over one game's view.

Three protocols, split by what a seat consumes — none sees anything the
player wouldn't: :class:`Policy` reads the acting player's partial
observation; :class:`BeliefPolicy` reads the engine's honest
:class:`~catan_engine.belief.BeliefView` (model-based agents rebuild a
concrete world with ``sample_world`` and search there); :class:`GameAgent`
reads the same partial observation but is a *stateful per-game object*,
driven step-by-step in Python (plans and memories persist across its own
moves; not traceable, so it never enters a jit/vmap). All are valid at any
player count.

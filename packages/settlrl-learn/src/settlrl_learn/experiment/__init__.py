"""Experiment harness shared by every framework under ``experiments/``.

Kept here (not under ``experiments/``, which holds only per-framework scripts +
the ``new.py`` scaffolder) so the reusable pieces live in the library. Not
imported by the agents runtime, so ``import settlrl_agents`` does not pull the
config dependencies.

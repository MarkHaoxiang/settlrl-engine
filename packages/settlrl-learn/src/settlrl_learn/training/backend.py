"""The backend seam of the training loop and the run-state it checkpoints.

A :class:`Backend` bundles everything net-specific: how to build the net, adapt
it to the search seams and a play agent, turn board positions into replay items,
and run one optimiser step / eval. :mod:`settlrl_learn.training.loop` is otherwise
net-agnostic, so the flat-MLP (:class:`~settlrl_learn.training.mlp_backend.MLPBackend`)
and board-GNN (:class:`~settlrl_learn.training.gnn_backend.GNNBackend`) paths share
one loop.

:class:`RunState` is the whole mutable run state, eqx-serialised for **bit-exact
resume** -- eqx's leaf serialiser fits both an equinox module and a plain-JAX
pytree, and the per-iteration RNG is a pure function of the seed and iteration
index, so a resumed run continues bit-identically.

A training-side module: not imported by the package root.

"""The Stage-1 gate: the net's win rate vs. a fixed ``POLICIES`` opponent,
seat-swapped at 2p.

A learned value worth shipping beats ``lookahead(heuristic)``; ``random`` is the
lower-bound sanity check. The agent (search, plus any setup delegation) comes from
the backend, so this is net-agnostic.

A training-side module: not imported by the package root.

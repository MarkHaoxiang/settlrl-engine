# settlrl-app

The Settlrl game server. FastAPI serves the game over a JSON + SSE API, runs the
async game runtime, persists games and accounts, and serves the SPA; a Vite +
React + TypeScript frontend renders the board as SVG. The game model itself is
`settlrl-game`; bot moves are delegated to a remote bot service
(`settlrl-agents[service]`). The app depends on neither the engine nor the
agents directly.

A menu lets you choose between two modes, each at its own URL.

**Play** (`/play`) — a live, playable game. Each seat is configured per game as a human sharing the screen (hotseat) or a bot (a `settlrl-agents` policy); with no human seats the game plays itself as a spectated bot match. Search bots expose their build parameters, like `mcts`'s simulation budget, behind the seat's gear button. The interface is the table itself:

- **Board** — every placement you can currently make is marked in your colour (hover to preview the piece); click it and confirm in a popup that shows the build cost or who to rob.
- **Hand** — click a glowing development card to play it (resource picks come from a popover), or resource cards to discard after a 7; a knight can also be played straight off the robber pawn, which lights up to take the click.
- **Trading** — click a bank resource pile to maritime-trade at your best port rate, or an opponent's hand pile to compose a 1:1 offer they answer on their turn; buy a development card from the bank's deck.
- **Table scene** — top-down, with zoom, pan, and spin (mouse, touch, or keyboard: arrows pan, `+`/`−` zoom, `[` `]` spin, `0` re-fits). When you hold a single seat the table opens rotated to face it (your play area at the bottom); spectating or a shared-screen hotseat keeps the canonical bottom-facing view. The bank's card piles sit left of the board; each seat's play area lines its table edge with its face-down hand and dev piles and unbuilt roads, settlements, and cities. The dice rest in the corner beside the acting seat and take the click to roll.
- **Bars and panels** — a bottom bar shows the acting human's hand and the remaining actions (answer a trade, end turn); the top bar holds New game and a light/dark theme toggle. The right column lists the seats in playing order (points, cards, devs, and 🔍 to inspect an opponent's proven hand bounds) above a chat panel that doubles as the game log.
- **New game** — a dialog (on entry and from the New game button) sets player count (2 or 4), what controls each seat, seating across several humans (hotseat here, or online via an invite link), number-token placement (random or spiral), and an optional seed.

A help page (`/help`, the **?** button) documents the controls and icons.

**Replay** (`/replay`) — step through a recorded game. Load a saved game-record file (the JSON from `GET /api/games/{id}/record`) or the live game so far, then scrub with the slider, step move by move, or press play; the log fills in as the game advances, and the record can be saved back to a file.

Each game is a plain-Python `settlrl-reference` game; the server holds many live
games at once, addressed by id.
Claiming a human seat (creating or joining a game) issues a bearer token, and every request
proves its seats via the `X-Seat-Tokens` header: snapshots are per-seat views — your own
hand arrives in full, everyone else's only as public counts, and the legal-move list only
ships to the seat whose turn it is. Games are shareable: the 🔗 button copies the invite
link, and opening it claims a free human seat (or spectates when none is left); the 🔑 button
copies a resume link that carries your seat tokens, so you can restore the exact seats you
hold on another device or after clearing storage. A game with unclaimed human seats waits in
a **lobby** — it serves no moves and advances neither bots nor turn timeouts — until every
human seat is filled, then begins on its own. The server
pushes state: each client holds an event stream (`GET /api/games/{id}/events`, SSE) and
receives its per-seat snapshot on every change, and bot seats are played by a server-side
driver pacing one move at a time so each lands as its own pushed snapshot — games advance
with no tab open, and every move animates.

## Requirements

- Python ≥ 3.12 with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- Node.js ≥ 18

## Development

The quickest start is the dev launcher, which boots the API, a couple of one-bot
services, and the frontend together, pre-registers an admin account
(`dev@example.com` / `devpassword`), and registers the bot services so bots are
seatable on first load. Ctrl-C stops everything.

```bash
./packages/settlrl-app/dev.sh
```

To run the pieces by hand instead, start the API server and the frontend dev
server in separate terminals from the repo root.

**Terminal 1 — API (port 8000)**
```bash
uv run settlrl-app
```

The server runs JAX on CPU by default (one live game doesn't need a GPU, and JAX would
otherwise preallocate most of its memory). Set `JAX_PLATFORMS=cuda` to override.

**Terminal 2 — frontend (port 5173)**
```bash
cd packages/settlrl-app/frontend
npm install   # first time only
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173. The Vite dev server proxies `/api/*` to the FastAPI server, so hot-reload and the API work together out of the box.

## Production build

Build the frontend into `frontend/dist/`, then start the API server — it detects the built assets and serves them automatically.

```bash
cd packages/settlrl-app/frontend && npm run build
uv run settlrl-app
```

Open http://localhost:8000.

## Hosting

The server is configured by environment variables: `HOST` (default `0.0.0.0`),
`PORT` (default `8000`), `RELOAD` (default `1`; set `0` in production — the
reloader is a dev file-watcher),
`SETTLRL_APP_STATE_DIR` (a directory to persist games in — see below),
`SETTLRL_APP_TURN_TIMEOUT_S` (default `0` = off; after this many seconds of an
idle human turn the server auto-plays a move, so an abandoned game still
finishes instead of stalling), `SETTLRL_APP_MAX_ACTIVE` (default `16`; games
running at once before new creators are queued — keep it below the registry
cap), and `ROOT_PATH` (the proxy prefix when served under a path). Run **one
process, one worker**: live games are held in memory,
so extra workers would split them.
The registry holds up to 32 games, evicting finished games, hour-idle ones, or
unstarted ones idle past a few minutes (so a burst of empty games can't pin
every slot) to make room.

**Persistence.** Without `SETTLRL_APP_STATE_DIR`, games live only in memory and
a restart loses them. Point it at a (mounted) directory and each game is
journalled — its setup plus every move, seat claim, and chat line — into the same
SQLite database as accounts (`settlrl.db` there) and replayed back into the
registry on the next startup, so a deploy or crash resumes games in progress,
seat tokens and all. Bot pacing restarts for resumed games. Evicted games are
dropped from the database.

Anyone can create games; the concurrency cap queues them past
`SETTLRL_APP_MAX_ACTIVE`. For a public deployment, front the server with a
proxy that rate-limits — the built-in caps (a 2 MB request-body limit, a replay
move-count cap, and high-entropy game ids) bound resource use but are not a
substitute for one.

The repo-root `Dockerfile` builds a self-contained image (frontend compiled
in, CPU JAX):

```bash
docker build -t settlrl-app .
docker run -p 8000:8000 settlrl-app
```

To serve under a path instead of a (sub)domain — e.g. `markhaoxiang.com/settlrl`
behind a proxy that strips the prefix (Caddy `handle_path /settlrl/*`) — bake
the prefix into the frontend and tell FastAPI about it:

```bash
docker build -t settlrl-app --build-arg BASE_PATH=/settlrl/ .
docker run -p 8000:8000 -e ROOT_PATH=/settlrl settlrl-app
```

The mark-haoxiang repo's `infra/` wires this up as the `settlrl` compose
service behind its Caddy.

Seat tokens are bearer secrets, so put TLS in front for anything beyond a
LAN — e.g. Caddy, which manages certificates itself:

```
games.example.com {
    reverse_proxy localhost:8000
}
```

## Accounts

Accounts are optional: anonymous play — claim a seat, get a per-seat token —
works without one. Registering gives a player a persistent identity and lets an
operator mark some users as **admins**, who manage the bot services below. In
the UI the menu's **Sign in** link opens the account page (`/login`,
`/register`).

Accounts are handled by [fastapi-users](https://fastapi-users.github.io/fastapi-users/).
Login uses the OAuth2 password flow (`POST /api/auth/login` returns a bearer
token presented as `Authorization: Bearer …`); tokens are stored server-side, so
`POST /api/auth/logout` truly revokes one. Accounts, tokens, and games all share
the one SQLite database (`settlrl.db` under the state dir, or
`SETTLRL_APP_USER_DB`). Emails listed in `SETTLRL_APP_ADMIN_EMAILS`
(comma-separated) are granted admin on register and login. Endpoints:
`POST /api/auth/register`, `POST /api/auth/login`, `POST /api/auth/logout`,
`GET /api/users/me`.

**Seats follow the account.** A seat claimed while signed in is tied to your
user id, not just the per-device seat token, so you are recognised — and can
resume your games (`GET /api/me/games`) — on any device without carrying the
token. Send the bearer token alongside (or instead of) `X-Seat-Tokens`; each
snapshot's `your_seats` lists the seats the requester owns either way.

**Profile and history.** The account link opens the **profile** page
(`/profile`): your in-progress games plus a history of finished ones
(`GET /api/me/history`), each replayable or downloadable by id. Finished games
are kept in the store (a capped, replayable archive) rather than discarded, so
their record is served even after the live game is evicted — the same record the
end-of-game screen's **Download replay** button saves.

## Leaderboard

The menu's **Leaderboard** page (`/leaderboard`, public) ranks players by skill,
**split by player count** — a 2-, 3-, and 4-player ladder are kept separately.
Both registered accounts (shown by their handle) and bots (shown by name) are
rated on the same ladders, so games against bots count. Rating uses
[openskill](https://github.com/vivekjoshy/openskill.py) (the patent-free
Weng-Lin / Plackett-Luce model): when a game ends its final standings are scored
winner-takes-all (the winner ranks first, the rest tie behind) and the whole
table is rated in one step. The displayed number is the conservative ordinal
scaled to an Elo-like range (a fresh player shows ~1000). A seat that is neither
an account nor a bot (an anonymous, token-only human) is not rated, and a bot
occupying more than one seat in a game is skipped for that game. Endpoint:
`GET /api/leaderboard`.

## Bot services

The game server runs **no** agent code in-process. A seat's bot moves are
computed by a separate **bot service** — each service hosts **one bot**
(`settlrl-agents[service]`), deployed and scaled apart from the game server. It
speaks a standardized, structured two-call API:

- `GET /info` — the bot's identity (`{ name, title, description, counts }`).
- `POST /act` — given a game's setup and the moves the service has not seen yet
  (structured `MoveModel`s in board coordinates, the tail after a `base` cursor),
  it advances the game it is tracking and returns the acting seat's chosen move.
  When the service is behind/ahead it answers `409 { resync, have }` and the
  request is replayed from there. No engine indices cross the wire — only the
  (stable) setup and the coordinate action shapes.

```bash
BOT_PORT=8100 uv run --package settlrl-agents settlrl-bot-service --bot greedy
```

An **admin** registers a service by base URL at runtime; its bot self-identifies
via `GET /info` and joins the catalog under its own name:

| Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/admin/bot-providers` | List registered bot services (admin) |
| `POST /api/admin/bot-providers` | Register one `{ "base_url" }` (admin); `400` if unreachable |
| `DELETE /api/admin/bot-providers/{name}` | Unregister one by bot name (admin) |

`GET /api/bots` is empty until a service is registered, and every bot move is
delegated over the API. A remote service that is slow or fails (or an abandoned
human turn) falls back to a trivial local random move, so a game never stalls.
Registrations live in memory, so re-register services after a restart.

## Tests

The app builds its board coordinate tables and resource / dev-card
orderings from `settlrl-reference`'s geometry and enums, and defines its own
flat action space over reference actions; the test suite checks the geometry is
well-formed, pins the enum-derived orderings, and round-trips the flat table
(every legal flat reconstructs a legal reference action and maps back to itself).

The server tests follow its layering: `test_games.py` covers the registry and
seat claims, `test_views.py` covers the per-seat snapshots —
including a sweep asserting that no observer's view ever leaks another hand —
and `test_server.py` covers only what routes own (auth, status codes, locking),
each test building its own app via `create_app`. The wire contract is pinned
twice: pytest checks the committed `frontend/openapi.json` against the live
schema, and the frontend's wire types are generated from it (`npm run gen-api`
regenerates both whenever `models.py` changes).

```bash
uv run pytest packages/settlrl-app/tests
```

A browser end-to-end suite drives the real app (create / join / spectate and
per-seat redaction over the wire); it needs a running server with a built
frontend and a system Chromium:

```bash
cd packages/settlrl-app/frontend
BASE=http://localhost:8000 npm run e2e
```

## API

| Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|
| `POST /api/games` | Create a game `{ "seed", "n_players": 2 \| 4, "number_placement", "seats": [...], "claim": "all" \| "first" \| "none", "ticket"? }` — returns the game id and the creator's seat tokens. At the concurrency cap, returns `202` with a queue position `{ "queued": true, "ticket", "position", "total" }`; re-POST with the `ticket` to keep your place until a slot frees |
| `POST /api/games/{id}/join` | Claim a human seat `{ "seat"?: <n> }` (first free one by default) — returns the seat and its token. `409` when taken/full |
| `GET /api/games/{id}` | The requester's snapshot: board + status + their legal moves (`X-Seat-Tokens` header; omit to spectate) |
| `POST /api/games/{id}/action` | Apply the acting seat's move `{ "flat": <action index> }` — `403` without that seat's token, `409` if illegal |
| `GET /api/games/{id}/events` | Server-sent events: the requester's snapshot immediately, then again on every change (`bot_move` carries the server-paced bot play just made) |
| `POST /api/games/{id}/chat` | Append a chat message `{ "text", "player"?: <owned seat> }` (no seat: spectator) |
| `GET /api/games/{id}/record` | The finished game as a replayable `GameRecord` transcript — served for past games too, rebuilt from the store (`409` while running; `404` if unknown) |
| `POST /api/games/{id}/replay` | Load a finished game for replay — a past game too (`409` while running; `404` if unknown) |
| `POST /api/replay` | Load a game record (the record JSON) for replay; returns the opening state. `422` if malformed |
| `GET /api/replay/state?move=N` | The loaded replay after `N` moves (0 = the opening board). `404` until a replay is loaded |
| `GET /api/replay/record` | The loaded replay's record JSON (to save it to a file) |
| `GET /api/bots` | Bot kinds available for seats (built-in + registered remote services), each with the player counts it supports and its configurable parameters |
| `POST /api/auth/register` · `/login` · `/logout` · `GET /api/users/me` | Optional accounts (OAuth2 password flow; see [Accounts](#accounts)) |
| `GET /api/me/games` | The signed-in user's live games — seats follow the account across devices |
| `GET /api/me/history` | The signed-in user's finished games (newest first) — replayable / downloadable by id |
| `GET /api/leaderboard` | Elo ratings for accounts and bots, per player-count bucket, best first (public; see [Leaderboard](#leaderboard)) |
| `GET` · `POST` · `DELETE /api/admin/bot-providers` | Manage remote bot services (admin; see [Bot services](#bot-services)) |
| `GET /docs` | Interactive API docs (Swagger UI) |

Each legal move in `GET /api/games/{id}` is a decoded action descriptor carrying its `flat` index
(post it back to apply it), a `type`, a human `label`, and — depending on the type — the board
target (`vertex` / `edge` / `tile` + `victim`) or resources involved, in the same cube/axial
coordinates the board uses.

Example response:
```json
{
  "tiles": [
    { "q": 0, "r": -2, "terrain": "ore", "number": 10 },
    { "q": 1, "r": -2, "terrain": "sheep", "number": 2 },
    ...
  ]
}
```

Tile position uses **axial coordinates** with a pointy-top hex orientation. The board is a hexagon of radius 2 (19 tiles) centred on `(0, 0)`. The layout (terrain and number tokens) is generated by `settlrl-game`'s reference rules, so it is randomised per server start rather than fixed.

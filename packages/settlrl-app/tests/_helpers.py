"""Shared test helpers.

The game server runs no bots itself, so any test that seats or plays a bot needs
in-process bot services registered with it. Each service hosts ONE bot, so
``bot_app`` mounts a one-bot service per kind under ``/<kind>`` (one ASGI client
then reaches them all), and ``bot_registry`` stuffs a provider per bot straight
into a registry (white-box, no admin/HTTP/event-loop dance at setup time).
``BOT_KINDS`` is what such seats validate against when a ``GameSession`` is built
directly.

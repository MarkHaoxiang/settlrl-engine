"""Pre-game lobbies: a configurable staging table that becomes a game on start.

A :class:`Lobby` holds only configuration and membership — never a
``GameSession``. The board shown in the room is a preview from the seed (the
game-free ``GET /api/preview``); the engine is built exactly once, at start, by
materialising the lobby into a :class:`~settlrl_app.game.games.GameHandle`.

Keeping the two apart makes the illegal states unrepresentable: you cannot
configure a game that has begun, and you cannot start a table that still has open
seats. The mode fixes whether seats can be open:

- ``"online"`` — human seats start open; others join them and changes stream live.
- ``"hotseat"`` — one browser drives every human seat (all claimed at create), so
  there are no open seats and it can start at once.

Lobbies are in-memory only: they are pre-game and disposable (a lost lobby just
means re-hosting), so unlike games they are never journalled.

"""Lobby routes (``/api/lobbies*``): a pre-game table you configure, others
join, and the host starts — at which point it materialises into a game.

A lobby never holds a ``GameSession``; the room renders a board *preview* from
the seed. ``POST /api/lobbies/{id}/start`` builds the engine, copies the claimed
seats into a fresh game (so everyone keeps their seat token), and hands back the
game id. Start is allowed only when no human seat is still open, so a half-empty
table can never begin.

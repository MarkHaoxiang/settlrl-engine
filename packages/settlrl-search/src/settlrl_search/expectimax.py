"""A specialized search for the **setup phase** (the initial settlement/road
placements) -- a depth-limited, beam-pruned *probabilistic expectimax*.

Setup is a short, fully-observable, high-leverage sub-game: there are no cards
yet, so nothing is hidden, and the two opening settlements decide the whole
economy. It is also structurally distinct from the main loop, so the learned net
does not handle it -- this fixed policy does.

The search backs up a **per-player value vector** (the heuristic value from each
seat) so every node knows the mover's own value. At the searcher's nodes it
maximizes (we assume we play the opener optimally); at an opponent's nodes it
takes a **Boltzmann expectation** over that opponent's self-interested moves --
``softmax(opponent_value / temperature)``. ``temperature`` is the chance the
opponent plays a non-optimal placement: ``-> 0`` is an optimal (minimax)
opponent, large is uniform-random. Modeling opponents as imperfect matters most
with **more than two players**, where assuming three optimal openers is far too
pessimistic.

It is built as a **full ``beam``-ary tree expanded level by level** (node ``i``'s
children are ``beam*i .. beam*i+beam-1`` one level down). Each level is one
``vmap(apply_action)`` over the frontier -- compiled once per level, so the cost
is ``depth`` compiles, not the thousands of inlined transitions a recursive
unroll would bake in (the latter compiles for minutes past depth ~4). A modest
``beam`` keeps ``beam**depth`` states tractable, so depth 6-8 -- enough to reach
the *complementary second settlement* in snake order -- is reachable.
